# ATM Simulation System

## Overview
The **ATM Simulation System** is a Python-based desktop application built with **Tkinter** that replicates common banking operations in a simulated environment.  
It allows users to log in with a PIN, check balances, deposit funds, and withdraw money with proper **input validation**, **error handling**, and basic **security measures**.
